## Code examples

GitHub repository
: [Billmate/QvicklyAPISamples](https://github.com/Billmate/QvicklyAPISamples)

The code examples contains both a simple package to communicate with the API's as well as examples on how to use the API's. The examples are the same as the ones found in this documentation.

## Modules

Currently there are only one module available.

### PHP module

The Qvickly PHP module is a more advanced module that is built on top of the API code. The module is built to make it easier to use the API. It covers all of Qvickly's public API's. There are also some examples on how to best use the module.

Packagist
: [qvickly/api](https://packagist.org/packages/qvickly/api)

## API vs module
The API code is a bare minimum example of how to use the API.

The module code is a more advanced example of how to use the API and is more or less an advanced wrapper based on the API code.

## Languages
The different statuses are as follows

| Status      | Description                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Complete    | The code is finished.                                   |
| Testing     | The code is being tested.                               |
| Nearly done | The code is almost finished.                            |
| Started     | The code is started but not finished.                   |
| Deprecated  | The code is deprecated.                                 |
| As-is       | The code is as-is and will not be updated.              |
| Planned     | The code is planned but not started yet.                |
| n/a         | Not applicable or there is no plan to create this code. |

### %code-php%
The newer PHP code examples are adopted for PHP 8.x. They are however based on the same principles as the original PHP code examples and might therefore not always be cutting edge.

### %code-phplegacy%
The original PHP code example was written in early PHP 5.x. This code has been rewritten and updated to work with PHP 8.x but without any bells and whistles.

### %code-dotnet%
There is one DLL-file for the .NET code examples. The DLL-file is a wrapper for the Qvickly API but the origin is unknown and can most likely only serve as a reference.

There are also some simple .NET code examples available for download.

### %code-go%
The Go code examples are based on Go 1.x.

Go implementations are unfortunately all but pretty. This is due to the fact that Go is not a language that is well suited for the kind of API calls that are required for the Qvickly API since the API uses some non-strict types.
