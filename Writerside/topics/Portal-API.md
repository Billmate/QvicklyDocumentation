The portal is a web application that allow merchants to manage their invoices, customers, and products. The API is used to interact with the portal.

Currently, the documentation is based on the OpenAPI specification for the Portal API. Since this is an import from an existing swagger file, the documentation may not be complete. We plan to convert it to fit our generic documentation format.


The Portal API is the base for the portal and is used to interact with the portal. The API is used to manage invoices, customers, and products.

The portal can be accessed at [https://portal.qvickly.io](https://portal.qvickly.io).
