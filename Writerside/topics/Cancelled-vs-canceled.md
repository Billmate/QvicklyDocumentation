# Cancelled vs canceled

<include from="Snippets-PaylinkAPI.md" element-id="snippet-header" />

As some of you might have noticed there are two different spellings of the word "cancelled" used in this documentation. The two spellings are "cancelled" and "canceled". The difference between the two is that "cancelled" is the British English spelling, and "canceled" is the American English spelling.

In the text of this documentation we try to use the British English spelling "cancelled" as much as possible. However, there might be some instances where the American English spelling "canceled" is used.

The name of the endpoint for cancelled paylinks is "canceled" with one "l". This is because the endpoint is for some reason named after the American English spelling of the word.
