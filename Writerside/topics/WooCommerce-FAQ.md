## Decimals
Qvickly WooCommerce plugin requires that the currency is set to 2 decimals. If you have a different setting, you will need to change it to 2 decimals.

Using less than 2 decimals will most likely cause prices and taxes to be calculated incorrectly. Incorrect calculations can lead to errors when sending them to the server.

If you are unsure how to do this, please contact your WooCommerce support.
