# Credentials

<include from="Snippets-AuthAPI.md" element-id="snippet-header" />

There are two ways of authenticating with this API.

1. Username and password
2. BankID

The authentication is person based and is not meant for distributors. The system currently only allows one user per merchant account. BankID can only be connected to one user account. BankID is the recommended way of authenticating.

*To be able to access multiple merchant accounts, you need to have multiple users. The downside of this is that only one of them can be connected to BankID*
