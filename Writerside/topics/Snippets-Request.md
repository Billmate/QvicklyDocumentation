| callbackurl   | false    | string | Url to which callback data is sent after the customer has succesfully completed a card or bank payment. Data returned is same as for addPayment defined below and for accepturl. Callback is made same time as accepturl, thus it can’t be assumed that callback data will arrive before accepturl data. No response is required to a callback request, the data just has to be received. If callback data is not received, Billmate server will try to send callback data again once a minute first 10 minutes, once an hour first 10 hours, once a day first 7 days, then finally once a month for next 3 months. |

> Note: The `accepturl`, `cancelurl` and `callbackurl` used to reside in the Card section. But since they became common for other payment methods, they are now part of the PaymentData section.

| callbackurl  | false    | string | Url to which callback data is sent after the customer has succesfully completed a card or bank payment. Data returned is same as for addPayment defined below and for accepturl. Callback is made same time as accepturl, thus it can’t be assumed that callback data will arrive before accepturl data. No response is required to a callback request, the data just has to be received. If callback data is not received, Billmate server will try to send callback data again once a minute first 10 minutes, once an hour first 10 hours, once a day first 7 days, then finally once a month for next 3 months. |

> Note: The `accepturl`, `cancelurl` and `callbackurl` can be used here. But the new common place for these is in the PaymentData section.
