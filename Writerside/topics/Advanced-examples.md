# Advanced examples

<include from="Snippets-PaymentAPI.md" element-id="snippet-header"></include>

In the future you will find some more advanced examples of how to use the Payment API. But currently we are working on other parts of the documentation. Please check back later.

These examples are meant to be used as a starting point for your own implementation. They are not meant to be used as is in a production environment.

Example pages will be grouped by language. This means that you might find different examples between languages.
