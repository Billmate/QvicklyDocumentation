# Paylink API

Paylinks are an adaption of the [Payment API](Qvickly-API.md) to allow for a more flexible payment process. The main difference is that the payment process is not started by the merchant, but by the customer. The merchant can create a paylink and send it to the customer. The customer can then use the paylink to start the payment process.
