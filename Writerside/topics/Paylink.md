# Paylink API

<include from="Snippets-PaylinkAPI.md" element-id="snippet-header" />


Paylinks are an adaption of the [Payment API](Qvickly-API.md) to allow for a more flexible payment process. The main difference is that the payment process is not started by the merchant, but by the customer. The merchant can create a paylink and send it to the customer. The customer can then use the paylink to start the payment process.

The documentation for the PaylinkAPI isn't really an API documentation, but more of a guide on how to use the PaylinkAPI. The PaylinkAPI is a part of the PaymentAPI and the documentation for the PaymentAPI can be found [here](Qvickly-API.md).
