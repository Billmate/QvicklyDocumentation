All old examples are undergoing verification and will be updated if needed in the near future.

The old PHP examples will be updated to PHP8.

The Python code will be based on a new package.

The Node.JS code will be based on a new package.

## Node.JS vs Deno vs Bun
Even though Node.JS is the most popular platform for JavaScript, it has some issues with the strict typing. The solution will probably be based on interface and that might not be a favorite amongst hard core purists.

The code for Node.JS, Deno and Bun is very similar but have some minor differences.

Both Bun and Deno are new platforms and are not yet widely used. We will add examples for these platforms when we have the time and resources to do so.
