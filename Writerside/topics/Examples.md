All old examples has been undergoing verification and has been updated. The old Billmate class has been updated to work better with PHP 8.x and changed name to PaymentAPI.

The old PHP examples has been updated to work with PHP8.

The Python code is based on a new package.

The Node.JS code is based on a new package.

The old C# code will not be updated at this time.

## Node.JS vs Deno vs Bun
Even though Node.JS is the most popular platform for JavaScript, it has some issues with the strict typing. The solution will probably be based on interface and that might not be a favorite amongst hard core purists.

The code for Node.JS, Deno and Bun is very similar but have some minor differences.

Both Bun and Deno are new platforms and are not yet widely used. We will add examples for these platforms when we have the time and resources to do so.
